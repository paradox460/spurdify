# Changes
**Added a new "mangle `O`s" feature.** Now the script will occasionally replace any letter `o` with a "spurdish" variant.

# Automatic Builds
I've got automatic builds running on Azure for Linux and OS X, and the releases will automatically be published here. You can check the badge on the readme for bleeding versions.

# Nim 20 compatibility
I didn't have to change anything, but we're now nim 20 compatible

# What about 0.0.3
I never released 0.0.3, because it only really involved the creation of library features (thanks for the PR @SolitudeSF!) and a Nimble package, and no new actual spurdification features
